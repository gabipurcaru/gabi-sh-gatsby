I'm lucky enough to spend a lot of time close to people way smarter than me, so naturally I try to learn as much as possible from them.

There are two main things I try to get out of these relationships:

## Tools

How do I do X? Sometimes you know you have to do something, but you don't know how to do it. For example, you want to convince someone to solve a problem. This is a daunting problem, because there are so many ways of doing it - you can try selling the solution to the problem, you can try selling the problem itself and why it matters, you can use authority and coercion, etc.

A good mentor can teach you the full range of tools at your disposal, when to use them and what the trade offs are.

For me, this is about 10% of the time spend learning from others, and it's mostly through circumstancial "a-ha!" moments.

This enlists fairly algorithmic thinking - "when you see X, do Y". When you see race conditions, use locks. When you have scaling problems, shard. When ownership is unclear, find a clear owner, make ownership explicit and keep them accountable. When timelines drift, communicate.

## Frames of mind

The other 90% is about frames of mind. What I mean by this is understanding what my role in a given situation should be. For example, what is my job about? The vague answer is "solving problems". But the scope of those problems is increasing as I progress. For example, you can think of going from "writing code specified by the PM or tech lead" to "creating new product features" to "making infrastructure scale" to "creating products", and at any step there's a dimension of leveraging other people to reach your goals.

This takes 90% of the time because it's hard. Getting to the crux of how a person's role in a given organisation should be seen and what alternatives and trade offs look like takes a lot of time. It's also hard because everyone defines their own career and there's no cookie cutter way of working that works for everyone. You have to take what others are doing and apply what works for you.

These are the topics that take years to unfold, and the answer is anything but algorithmic - what are your career goals? How do you create feedback loops for your own growth? How do you keep yourself accountable?

```javascript
const a = () =>
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("test");
  }, 100);
```
